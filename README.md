__My Learning__

I am learning towards Robot Framework Level 2. </br>

<b>The main goal of Level 2</b> </br>
: To create and run my own robot </br>
: To learn best practices </br>
: To have a solid understanding of the basics of Robocorp automation </br>

<b>My robot should: </b></br>
: Use the orders file (.csv ) and complete all the orders in the file. </br>
: Save each order HTML receipt as a PDF file.</br>
: Save a screenshot of each of the ordered robots.</br>
: Embed the screenshot of the robot to the PDF receipt.</br>

So far, it has been challenging but fun!
